This is the code written for my Master's dissertation project at UEA. The objective of the project was to create and implement a playable implementation of the board game Hex, invented by Piet Hein, as well as explore implementations of AI algorithms to play the game as opponents to the human player. The algorithms implemented were the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and the Minimax algorithm, using a novel evaluation function based on the concept of resistance distance in graphs.
